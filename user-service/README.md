# User Service Guide

## Setting-up

> Note: If you are familiar to MongoDB and wish to use a local instance, please feel free to do so. This guide utilises MongoDB Cloud Services.

1. Set up a MongoDB Shared Cluster by following the steps in this [Guide](./MongoDBSetup.md).

2. After setting up, go to the Database Deployment Page. You would see a list of the Databases you have set up. Select `Connect` on the cluster you just created earlier on for User Service.

3. Select the `Drivers` option, as we have to link to a Node.js App (User Service)

![alt text](./GuideAssets/DriverSelection.png)

4. Select `Node.js` in the `Driver` pull-down menu, and copy the connection string.

Notice, you may see `<password>` in this connection string. We will be replacing this with the admin account password that we created earlier on when setting up the Shared Cluster.

5. Rename the `.env.sample` file to `.env` in the `user-service` directory.

6. Update the `DB_CLOUD_URI` of the `.env` file, and paste the string we copied earlier in step 4. Also remember to replace the `<password>` placeholder with the actual password.

```
DB_CLOUD_URI=<CONNECTION_STRING>
DB_LOCAL_URI=mongodb://localhost/${KEY_IN_YOUR_DB_HERE}
PORT=3001
ENV=PROD
```

## Running User Service

1. Open Command Line/Terminal and navigate into the `user-service` directory.

2. Run the command: `npm install`. This will install all the necessary dependencies.

3. Run the command `npm start` to start the User Service.

4. Using applications like Postman, you can interact with the User Service on port 3001. If you wish to change this, please update the `.env` file.
